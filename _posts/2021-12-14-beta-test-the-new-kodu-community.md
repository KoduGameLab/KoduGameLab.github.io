## Kodu 1.6 and New Community Beta Test

Beta test the new Kodu!  

At the end of the year the existing Community site will go away.  We've been busy creating a replacement for the Community and need some help testing it.  For technical reasons the new Community will also require a new version of Kodu.  This will be version 1.6.  **After mid-January older versions of Kodu will not be able to access the Community site.**  We do plan on moving all the old worlds to the new system once we’re sure it is stable.

You can download the Kodu 1.6.9.0 here:<br>
[KoduSetup_1.6.9.0.exe](https://kodugamelab.blob.core.windows.net:443/blob/Builds/KoduSetup_1.6.9.0.exe)<br>
[KoduSetup_1.6.9.0.msi](https://kodugamelab.blob.core.windows.net:443/blob/Builds/KoduSetup_1.6.9.0.msi)

The Community should look and act almost exactly as it did before with, hopefully, some performance improvements.  For testing we ask that you create and share worlds and download worlds shared by others.  In particular, please test worlds with multiple linked levels.  Note that if we run into problems during testing, we may reset the database so don’t delete any worlds off your machine that you want to keep.

If you find anything that doesn’t work as expected please send email to <KoduSupport@InfiniteInstant.com>.  Please include the exact version of Kodu you are running and detailed steps on how to recreate the problem.

If all goes well, 1.6 will be fully released in the next couple of weeks.  Thanks for your help!
