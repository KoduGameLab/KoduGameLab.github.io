## Hello!
Hi, I'd like to introduce myself.  I'm Stephen Coy (scoy).  I'm one of the original Kodu developers and have been working on Kodu since the project was started 14 years ago in Microsoft Research.  For the last several years I've been the only person working on Kodu full time.  Recently, I left Microsoft.  I didn't want Kodu to just disappear when I left so before leaving I was able to shepherd Kodu through the process of being released as open source.  Microsoft also kindly allowed me to take over the community database and web site. My plan is to continue to support Kodu for years to come.  Joining me will be Chris Phillips.  Chris worked with me at Microsoft and has basically done all the work on the web site and community for the last decade.

## What this means for you
Very little will change:
- The web site has moved.  We're now using GitHub pages to host the site.  This is both easier to work with and less expensive to maintain.  The URL remains <https://KoduGameLab.com>
- The support email address has changed.  It is now <KoduSupport@InfiniteInstant.com>.  This goes directly to my inbox so if you have any questions or suggestions feel free to write. 

Kodu will remain free for everyone to use. 

## Looking Forward
In the immediate future Chris and I are going to be working on reworking the community server and related web site to help bring the costs in line.  Hopefully, this will also make the whole system more efficient.  We think we can do this without any outages so this shouldn't affect Kodu use.

I've also been considering a Kodu Wiki to document in detail each of Kodu's programming tiles including their use, limitations, and samples.  Is this something you would find useful?  Let me know. 

As far as Kodu itself goes, I will continue to do new releases for bug fixes and minor feature additions.  In the longer term I'm also working on a new UI system for Kodu which will be more consistent and stable than the current system.
