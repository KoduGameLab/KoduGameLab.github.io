## New Kodu Release 1.5.81.0

Looks like I made a mistake with the last release which caused the terrain for worlds to disappear when imported.  Apologies.  This new version should fix the problem.

This release also fixes a problem with loading languages that only seemed to show up on systems set to Vietnamese. I'm still not 100% certain what caused the issue but this does fix it.
