# Kodu in the Microsoft Store
Kodu is now available in the Microsoft store.  This is the same as the desktop build with the bonus that it will automatically be updated as new versions are released.  You can find it [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/kodu-game-lab/9nv0b9m1vkwr).

*If you are using an older version of Windows not supported by the store you can use the Desktop Build below.*


# Kodu Desktop Build

The desktop builds are most useful when installing Kodu off-line. For instance, you can put the installer on a USB drive and install it on multiple PCs. You do not need to download both files. Regular users should download and install the KoduSetup.EXE file. The KoduSetup.MSI file is for system administrators installing Kodu via SCCM. 

## Latest Version : 1.5.76.0

[KoduSetup.EXE](https://kodugamelab.blob.core.windows.net/blob/Builds/KoduSetup_1.5.76.0.exe)

[KoduSetup.MSI](https://kodugamelab.blob.core.windows.net/blob/Builds/KoduSetup_1.5.76.0.msi)

Both the Microsoft Store build and the Desktop builds store the user's levels in the same location so you can freely switch between them without losing any work.

## XNA 4.0
Microsoft has recently stopped making the XNA 4.0 redistributable available for download.  If you install Kodu via the .MSI package you will need this. It comes included as part of the .EXE installer. You can now get the XNA 4 redistributable package here: [XNA 4 Redist](https://kodugamelab.blob.core.windows.net:443/blob/xnafx40_redist.msi)

## Legacy Versions
If you need a specific version of Kodu, email <KoduSupport@InfiniteInstant.com>.  I have most of the older versions and will make them available as needed.

## System Requirements
